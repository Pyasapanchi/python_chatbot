The installation process for Python depends on your operating system.  Let's focus on the most common ones:

**Windows:**

1. **Download:** Go to the official Python website (python.org).  Download the latest Python 3 release (avoid Python 2, as it's no longer supported).  Make sure to download the Windows installer (.exe file).

2. **Installation:** Run the downloaded installer.  During the installation process, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH." This makes it easier to run Python from your command prompt or terminal.  Click "Install Now" to proceed with the default settings, or customize the installation if needed.

3. **Verification:** After installation, open your command prompt (search for "cmd" in the Windows search bar) and type `python --version`.  If Python is installed correctly, you'll see the version number printed.


**macOS:**

1. **Download:** Visit python.org and download the macOS installer package (.pkg file).

2. **Installation:** Double-click the downloaded package and follow the on-screen instructions.  The installer will typically add Python to your system's PATH.

3. **Verification:** Open your terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and type `python3 --version`.  You should see the version number if the installation was successful.


**Linux:**

The method for installing Python on Linux varies depending on your distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian).  Generally, you'll use your distribution's package manager.  For example:

* **Ubuntu/Debian:**  Open your terminal and use the command `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt install python3`.
* **Fedora:** Use `sudo dnf install python3`.

After installation, verify by typing `python3 --version` in your terminal.


**Exercise:** Install Python on your system and verify the installation by checking the version.  Try running a simple Python script (e.g., `print("Hello, world!")`) from your command prompt or terminal.
